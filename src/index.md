<code>master</code> is <code>A-B-C-D</code> and <code>feature</code> is <code>A-B-E-F-G</code>

!SLIDE
# HEAD 

<code>HEAD</code> is the current branch/commit 

This will be the parent of the next commit

```
% cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
```

most of the time it points to a branch, but can point directly to a SHA when &#8220;detached&#8221;


!SLIDE 
# the reflog 
a log of recent <code>HEAD</code> movement

```

d72efc4 HEAD@{0}: commit: adding bar.txt

                        ↑

!SLIDE 
# dangling commit 

but they will be safe for ~30 days because of the reflog

                                        ↓
                    A---B---C---D---E---F
                        ↑
                     master (also HEAD@{0})

```

<code>HEAD@{1}</code> will become <code>HEAD@{2}</code>..<code>HEAD@{N}</code> as refs are added to the reflog

!SLIDE 
<br/>
# garbage collection 
once a dangling commit leaves the reflog, it is &#8220;loose&#8221; and is at risk of garbage collection

!SLIDE 
<br/>
# garbage collection 
git does a <code>gc</code> when the number of &#8220;loose&#8221; objects hits a threshold

something like every 1000 commits 

!SLIDE

# garbage collection 
to prevent garbage collecting a commit, just point something at it

```
% git tag mytag SHA_OF_DANGLING_COMMIT

# the &#8220;right&#8221; way to pull down changes from the server

1. <code>stash</code> any uncommitted changes (if any)
2. <code>fetch</code> the latest refs and commits from origin
3. <code>rebase -p</code> your changes (if any) onto origin's head<br/> else, just fast-forward your head to match origin's
4. un-<code>stash</code> any previously stashed changes

<code>fetch</code> + <code>rebase</code> avoids unnecessary commits

!SLIDE

# rebasing pull
<br/>
As of git 1.8.5, git has finally added a rebase switch to `pull`:

```
% git pull --rebase
```

This will do the `fetch` + `rebase` for you (you still stash on your own).
